        "        \n",
        "    - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "       \n",
        "       -  A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Abstraction: Hides complex implementation and shows only the necessary parts.\n",
        "    - Encapsulation: Wraps data and code together, restricting direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "         \n",
        "  -  \"Dunder\" means double underscore. These are special methods like __ init __, __ str __, __ len __, etc., used to define behavior for built-in operations.\n",

        "6   Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
